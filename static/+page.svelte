					Freon is an advanced language workbench that simplifies the creation of domain-specific languages (DSLs) through a web-based
					framework. With Freon, language engineers can define a language's structure, editor, scoper, typer, and validator—all from a
					concise set of definitions. By leveraging the power of projectional editing, Freon enables a smooth and intuitive development
					process, making it easier to build custom editing environments for specialized languages.
				</p>

				<p>
					Whether you're developing a DSL for a niche domain or designing a specialized tool for your organization, Freon provides the
					flexibility and scalability you need to quickly bring your ideas to life. Start creating your own custom language workbench with
					Freon today, and take advantage of its open-source framework and growing set of features to stay ahead in the world of web-based
					language development.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the heart of Freon lies a robust framework accompanied by five specialized generators, each dedicated to a crucial aspect of
					your language's work environment:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Language Structure: Define the core concepts, properties, and relationships inherent to your language.</li>
					<li>Editor: Customize the visual representation and editing commands, ensuring a user-friendly interface.</li>
					<li>Scoper: Establish rules for name resolution, managing references within your language models.</li>
					<li>Typer: Determine the types associated with language elements, enforcing consistency and correctness.</li>
					<li>Validator: Set validation rules to ensure models adhere to defined constraints, providing real-time feedback.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Join us in shaping the future of DSL development by exploring Freon today!</p>

						TriRadial Solutions is using Freon for the DSL in or Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) product. CRCs are the front-line staff
						that perform clinical trials for drugs and other health products. See XXX for an explanation of the product and some samples of
						the product UI. A DSL platform that is optimized for the Web is the void in today’s DSL technology. Having built DSLs using
						primitive tools like parsers and language servers as well as high-end tools like MPS, our assessment is that Freon is well on
						the way to being the ideal balance between these extremes. The path for integration with the LionWeb project positions Freon for
						even the most complex projects. Key features of Freon that we used:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Its DSL language for CRC DSL</li>
						<li>Its DSL editor framework for the entry of the DSL</li>
						<li>Its interpreter framework to run simulations of the scheduling</li>
						<li>Its storage framework to load and save the data.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						The Freon team has been wonderfully responsive to us when we were getting started and as we’ve made ever more advanced requests
						for new features. We would highly recommend using Freon on a DSL project and would be happy to speak with anyone looking to
						discuss our experience with Freon.
