# Industrial Research

I am doing my own industrial research, supported by a WBSO grant from the Dutch government.

I can also perform research projects for your company.
Usually a proof of concept / prototype is developed as part of the research,
because I find that this makes an otherwise potential theoretic concepts more concrete.
In the end you want to know whether new ideas will work in practice, not just whether they are conceptually good ideas.

If you are interested, you can contact Jos Warmer and we can discuss the possibilities.
