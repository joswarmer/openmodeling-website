# Projects

We can execute complete projects,  either in a mixed team with you own developers,  or with a dedicated team fron my network.

####
Through my business partner Itemis I have access to a large group of excellent people with an extensive background in model driven development.
Next to that I have a large network of independent experts for all roles needed for delivering a project.

In [projects](/Projects)  you can find some of the projects that I have been involved in.
Note that I am not a PowerPoint architect, as an architect I also take on the role of lead developer to make sure everything is developed the way it should.
