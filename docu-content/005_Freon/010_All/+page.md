#  Freon - The Language Workbench for the Web.

Freon is a web native language workbench, developed by Jos Warmer and Anneke Kleppe.
Freon is used to define Domain Specific Languages and the tooling needed to work with these languages.

The goal of Freon is to stimulate the use of DSL's on the web.
For this reason Freon is open source under the MIT license, so everyone can use it.
