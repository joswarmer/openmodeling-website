# MDA Explained

The book, MDA Explained, the Model Driven Architecture: Practise and Promise, thoroughly introduces, documents, and explains this important new framework. 

####
Model Driven Architecture is a major innovation in the field of software development. It is a framework for software development, in which modeling is the key part.
Within MDA the software development process is driven by the activity of modeling your software system. From a model with a high level of abstraction, a Platform Independent Model (PIM), one or more Platform Specific Models (PSMs) are generated. These PSMs are transformed into code. The generation process that will be automated to a large extend. The PIM drives this generation process.

The authors show how the transformations from PIM to PSM can be defined in a unambiguous way, thus enabling the creation of generic tools that are able to execute any transformation on any PIM. In addition, the book explains how current technology standards, like UML, OCL, XMI and CWM, fit in the framework, and how they can be put to use to generate code from high level models.

The book:

*  Illustrates a fundamental and broad view on MDA
*  Explains what model transformations are, and why they are important
*  Shows how the claimed advantages of MDA can be realized
*  Offers a large-scale, fully developed case study of the application of MDA transformations
*  Provides keen insight from the chief architect of one of the first MDA tools available.
