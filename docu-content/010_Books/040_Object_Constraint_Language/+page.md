# The Object Constraint Language

The Object Constraint Language - Getting Your Models Ready for MDA, is the book on OCL.  OCL is the standard constraint language for UML and especially popular at the meta modeling level.  The author, Jos Warmer,  is the chief architect of OCL.

"In this thoroughly revised edition, Jos en Anneke offer a concise, pragmatic, and pedagogic explanation of the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and its different applications. Their discussion of OCL's potential role in Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is timely and offers great insight into the way that UML can be taken to the next level of automated software development practice. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to get the most out of UML."

## An updated edition

The release of Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0 places renewed emphasis on the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Within UML, OCL is the standard for specifying expressions that add vital information to object-oriented models and other object-modeling artifacts. The number and extend of the changes in the 2.0 version of OCL justify the publication of an updated edition of the book that explains the language. This book is a practical, accessible guide to OCL 2.0 for software architects, designers, and developers.

The Model Driven Architecture (MDA), defined by the Object Management Group, relies on OCL to add the level of programming detail necessary to enable the automatic transformation of platform-independent models to platform-specific models. The second edition of this book includes an introduction to MDA and explains how OCL can be used within this architecture.
## Highlights

* Explains why OCL is critical to MDA - and why UML alone is not enough
* Introduces an SQL-like syntax to OCL
* Defines the new language constructs of OCL 2.0
* Demonstrates how OCL can be transformed into code
* Shares tips and tricks for applying OCL to real-world modeling challenges - showing which can be solved with UML and which require OCL

## The authors

The authors are Jos Warmer and Anneke Kleppe.
