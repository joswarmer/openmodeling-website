# LionWeb 2024.1 Release

LionWeb 2024.1 extends the [LionWeb](/LionWeb/Overview) specification with the Bulk Protocol for LionWeb repositories.
This protocol describes the API with a LionWeb repository, allowing models to be stored
and retrieved from a repository in a standard way.

Next to the specification a reference implementation of the LionWeb repository is available.
