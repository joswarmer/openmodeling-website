# Model Driven Development

Model Driven Development has many acronyms that are all used for slightly different but often overlapping things, we encounter:
 
- MDD - Model SDriven Developemnt
- MDA - Model Driven Architecture
- MDSE - Model Driven Software Engineering
- MBSD - Model Based Softwa Development 
- MDE - Model Driven Engineering
- DSM - Domain Specific Modeling
- DSL - Domain Specific languages

I won't try to explain the differences (on which people often disagree anyway :-)).
Instead, the pages shown below give an overview of how I view the modeling / language engineering world.
