# Insurance Product

Cleva (formerly I2S) is a Portuguese company that 
develops a product for Insurance companies.

## Work Done

As part of a large modernix=zation effort moving from IBM AS400 and RPG we developed
a DSL for specifying insurance products.
The DSL is strongly focussed on the complex formulea that are needed in Insurance.

Within I2S the poriginal thtough was to create the DSL using Xtext, but the in surance 
experts that tested out the prototype complained that _we are not programmers"  and
rejected the DSL.

We proposed to try out MPS, as the projectional editors in MPS allow for a DSL
that comes close to the way that the insurance experts already worked.

After a small PoC, the experts agreed and we developed the DSL in MPS.
