# ALEF

ALEF stands for Agile Law Execution Factory.
this tool is based on the 'RegelSpraak' DSL and is developed at the Dutch Tax Administration (DTA).

####


ALEF is used by Tax experts to specify the tax rules.
These rules can then be executed automatically in multiple environments.
The Tax experts themselves can execute the rules that were entered and run test cases to check whether the
rules are defined correctly.
After that, the same rules are also used to generate the actiual software that calculates the taxes. 

## Work Done

I have been part of the ALEF development team for several years.
I participated in the design of the various DSL's and had  
a strong focus on making the editors easy to use by the
tax experts who are the users of ALEF.
