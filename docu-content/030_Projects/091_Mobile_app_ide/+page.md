# Mobile App Ide

Service2Media is a award winning company that offers an App Lifecycle Platform for developing mobile applications.
Using this platform you can write an application once, and it will then run on multiple mobile platforms like Apple, Android, Microsoft, Blackberry and Nokia.

## Work Done
With Service2Media we developed an Eclipse based IDE to support developing Applications for he App Lifecycle Platform.
This makes development faster and will improve the quality of the delivered applications.

The IDE being developed is based on Eclipse and uses (amongst others) the following components:

* Ecore / EMF for defining the meta model
* Xtext for developing the editors
* Xtend for validation
* Tycho for continuous integration
