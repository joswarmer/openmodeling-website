# Medical Trials DSL

Clario is acompany that specializes in organizing medical trials.
Medical trial need to be specified very prciely to ensure that the evidence coming from a trial can be trusted.
Traials can be done for drugs, but also for medical devices.

####

For each trial a full description of the inetraction between the patioent, teh doctors needs to be specified. 
Also all medicine taken, all (side) effects etc. need to be followed.
This full specification of how the trial needs to be done is described in the so-called protocol.
Usually the protocol is specified using a combination of word and excel.

In this project we developed a DSL to exactly specify protocols.
Within trhe DSL environment the protocols could be simulated, a visual representation could be derived.
Also, the protocol specification could be used to generate (part  of) the configuration of the backend
systems that were being used to perform the traial.
