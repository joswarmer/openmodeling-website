Freon is a brainchild of **Jos Warmer** and **Anneke Kleppe**.
Both authors have many years of experience in working with software languages and DSLs in particular.

Jos and Anneke met at the University of Amsterdam in the 1980s, where they both received a 
thorough education in software development. Anneke graduated in Theoretical Computer Science, 
whereas Jos took a more practical approach with Software Engineering. From then on they have 
been working in the industry (KPN Research, IBM, Mendix, De Nederlandsche Bank, ...), 
but always with an interest in research. That is the reason 
that over the years they have published many scientific papers, and during some periods were employed by
universities. Currently, they are working independently, with their main focus on building DSLs.

In 1995 Jos, when working for IBM, became involved in the standardization of the Unified Modeling Language.
His unique contribution to the standard is the Object Constraint Language (OCL), a language in which 
extra rules, called constraints, about UML classes etc. can be expressed.

Both together and separately, Jos and Anneke wrote a number of books, some of them are listed below.

- **Software Language Engineering - Creating Domain-Specific Languages Using Metamodels**

  This book systematically introduces and explains every ingredient of an effective
  language specification, including its description of concepts, how those concepts are
  denoted, and what those concepts mean in relation to the problem domain.

- **The Object Constraint Language - Getting Your Models Ready for MDA**

  The Object Constraint Language - Getting Your Models Ready for MDA, is **the** book on OCL.
  OCL is the standard constraint language for UML and especially popular at the meta modeling level.

- **MDA Explained**
 
  MDA Explained gives a complete overview of the Model Driven Architecture.

- **Praktisch UML, 5de editie**

The most successful way of doing model driven development is through the use of domain specific languages (DSL),
with an integrated code generator.
A DSL is a language specifically designed for a domain, using the terminology of the domain experts as concepts
in the language.
Advantages of use a DSL can be found at multiple levels.

experience with the tools available for building DSLs. In short, Freon is the result of a lifetime of experience,
